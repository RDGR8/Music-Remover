## What Does The App do?
The app aims to provide the user with a local and easy way to filter music out of videos, inputting video and outputting a video free of music.

## Why?
The prophet of Islam صلى الله عليه وسلم said: "From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of **musical instruments**, as lawful..." (Narrated by al-Bukhari no. 5590)

## How Does it Work
The app uses MDX NET Inst HQ 3 model that separates the audio into vocals and instruments. It by default uses the CPU, but the GPU can be used which would be more efficient.

At the end the app combines the audio and video without interfering with the compression of the video, though the audio is compressed with its  original encoder.
